As someone who's trying to build skills around data visualization and data analysis, I've gotten somewhat frustrated at not being able to find data to work with. There's a lot of publically available data out there, in formats that are intended to be useful, but it's sometimes hard to find. 

Here's a small list of publically available data sources, of variable quality. DM me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/guacamolebio) or open a pull request if you have any sources you'd like to contribute! 

This list is currently loosely sorted by 'type' of data. 

 * [US Government-based sources](#us-government-based-sources)
 * [World Development](#world-development)
 * [Crime and Justice](#crime-and-justice)
 * [Health](#health)
 * [Other](#other)
 * [Large Collections](#large-collections-of-data)
 * [Fun things](#fun-things)
 * [Paid (but cheap) data](#cheap-data)
