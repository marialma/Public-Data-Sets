## Publically available data sets 

As someone who's trying to build skills around data visualization and data analysis, I've gotten somewhat frustrated at not being able to find data to work with. There's a lot of publically available data out there, in formats that are intended to be useful, but it's sometimes hard to find. 

Here's a small list of publically available data sources, of variable quality. DM me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/guacamolebio) or open a pull request if you have any sources you'd like to contribute! Eventually, I'd like to organize this list by topic.

### US Government-based sources
* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov) - A repository for all data the government collects that is not private or restricted. A literal gold mine.
    - _increase public access to high value, machine readable datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government."_
* [US Census](https://www.census.gov/) - Obviously the first place you go to for demographic data about the US. Also contains useful little bits, such as [geographic data](https://www.census.gov/geo/). 
* [CDC NHANES survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) - cross-sectional survey of health & nutritional status of the US population. **Make sure you understand the survey methods!**
* [Geospatial Platform](https://www.geoplatform.gov) - Super useful if you're interested in national level geospatial stuff.
    -_The GeoPlatform provides shared and trusted geospatial data, services, and applications for use by the public and by government agencies and partners to meet their mission needs._
* [USDA Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/) - All sorts of data related to agriculture and the agricultural trade in the US. 
    - _The mission of USDA's Economic Research Service is to anticipate trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America and to conduct high-quality, objective economic research to inform and enhance public and private decision making_

    - _Timely, accurate, and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture_
* [NASA Prognostics Data Repository](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) -
    - _A collection of data sets that have been donated by various universities, agencies, or companies. The data repository focuses exclusively on prognostic data sets, i.e., data sets that can be used for development of prognostic algorithms. Mostly these are time series of data from some nominal state to a failed state. The collection of data in this repository is an ongoing process._
* [NCEI Land-based Station Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data) - A whole lot of weather data.
    - _Land-based observations are collected from instruments sited at locations on every continent. They include temperature, dew point, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, visibility, atmospheric pressure, and types of weather occurrences such as hail, fog, and thunder._
